### User Stories
1. A **clinical researcher** named Alejandro. He wants to:
a. Input patient measurements to predict clinical output
b. Visualize their patient’s data in the context of the rest of the data (for certain variables/features)
c. Generate easy-to-interperet visual summary of concerns to share with the patient

Alejandro wants this software to be compatible with the clinical platform. **He should not have to clean data himself, change file types, or open jupyter**. He is **able to interpret clinical data (metabolites, disease markers) but needs visualizations to do so quickly**. He would also like to **have more simplistic charts to help the patient understand their risk**. 

2. **Software engineer**, BRENDA. She wants to:
a. Diagnose issues with the software.
b. Looking for potential security issues.
c. Pushing software updates.
d. Making the model more generalizable.

BRENDA wants the tool to have **descriptive error messages, be well-documented, have accessible version control, and contain usage statistics**. She is highly technical.

3. **Future multi-omics researcher**, *C. eligans*, looking to extend the tools to a different dataset.
a. They have a microbiome and metabolome dataset for patients with neurodegenerative diseases. 
b. They want to visualise the relationships between
c. They want to see if they can train a new model, using similar features to predict the status of a cohort of patients with parkinsons, Alzheimer’s, and non-Alzheimer's dementia.

*C. eligans* needs to know what input features they will be required to have for the tool to work, and **have these requirements well documented**. They have different microbiome diversities and different metabolic molecules of interest for their disease. They are an experienced multi-omics researcher but have **only rudimentary software development skills**. They have a modestly sized lab and might have capacity to hire a software engineer/data scientist but want to verify that this tool is worth pursuing before committing to the tool.
