loading data
target is presence of IHD, codes IHD372 and CIHD158
dataset contains 319 patients with IHD, 699 patients without, 1018 patients total
training data initially contains 1018 patients and 1222 features
selecting subset of features using univariate f-test
keeping 696/1222 features with f-statistic p-values < 0.025
splitting data into train, valid and test

running RFECV with 5-fold CV, step size of 25, using a logistic regression model as base
RFECV terminated finding 21/696 features useful
Now using random forest with a few numbers of estimators and using the features found by the RFECV
